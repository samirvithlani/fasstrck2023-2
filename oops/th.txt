POPS -> procedurial oriented programming structure
OOPS -> object oriented programming structure
    

diff bw oops and pops
1) oops is a programming structure where we can write the code in the form of classes and objects
2) pops is a programming structure where we can write the code in the form of functions



4 piller of oops
1) encapsulation
    1)class
    2)object
    3)method
    4)variable
    5)constructor
2) abstraction
3) inheritance
    types of inheritance
4) polymorphism
    1)overloading
    2)overriding

class -> 
1)class is a blueprint of an object, 
2)class is a collection of objects, 
3)class is a logical entity,
4)class is a template of an object
5)class is a user defined datatype
6)class is a collection of variables and methods


object ->
1)object is a real time entity / identity
2)object is a instance of a class

IS A RELATIONSHIP AND HAS A RELATIONSHIP

class        object
Vehicle       Car
Fruit        Mango

School       Student 

we have class keyword....
1)naimg convention to be followed for class name is camel casing
2)class name should always start with capital letter
3)class name should not contain any special character except underscore(_)
4)class name should not start with number
5)class name should not be a keyword
6)class name should not be a pre defined class name
7)class name should not be a pre defined annotation name
8)class name should be a noun


constructor in python:
1)constructotr is a special method in python, which is used to initialize the instance variables of a class
2)constructor will be defined __init__(self)
3)constructor will be executed automatically when we create an object

type of constructor
    1)default constructor
    2)parameterized constructor
    


inheritance:
1) child class can use properties of parent class is called as inheritance

types of inheritance
1)single level inheritance
2)multilevel inheritance
3)multiple inheritance
        * 1 parent class and multiple child class
        * 1 child class and multiple parent class [java does not support] 
4)hierarchical inheritance

                                    elizabeth
              prince charles         prince andrew         prince edward

   prince william    prince harry    princess beatrice    princess eugenie    prince edward                                 
                                                                                


5)hybrid inheritance



polymorphism : poly -> many, morphism -> forms, many forms of an object is called as polymorphism

1)compile time polymorphism -> method overloading
    :pytho does not support method overloading
    same name of functions is same class with different parameters is called as method overloading
2)run time polymorphism -> method overriding
