what is python:
python is interpreted high level programming language for general purpose programming.

scripting language:

2 type of prog/ scripting language are there
1)statically typed language

    when we declare a variable we have to specify the data type of the variable


2)dynamically typed language

    when we declare a variable we dont have to specify the data type of the variable


#variable declation rules:
1) variable name should not start with number
2) variable name should not contain any special character except underscore(_)
3) variable name must not contain any space
5) variable name should not be a keyword
6) variable name should not be a built in function name


TypeCasting:
1)implicit type casting
    :-> when we assign a value of one data type to another data type then
     python automatically converts the data type of the variable according to the value assigned to it.

     float-> 10.   10.0
2)explicit type casting
    :-> when we convert the data type of a variable to some other data type


    float 10.100 --> int(10) 10


    narrow casting
        --> converting higher data type to lower data type
        float --> int
    widening casting
        --> converting lower data type to higher data type
        int --> float


operators: operators are the special symbols that are used to perform some operations on the operands

1)binary operators : --> operators that require 2 operands to perform an operation
2)unary operators : --> operators that require 1 operand to perform an operation
3)ternary operators    :- operators that require 3 operands to perform an operation

types of operators:
1)arithmetic operators +,-,*,/,%, //,**
2)assignment operators =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,//=,**=
3)comparison operators ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=
4)logical operators and,or,not
5)bitwise operators &,|,^,~,<<,>>
6)identity operators is,is not
7)membership operators in,not in

Take salary from  user monthly : 20000 pm --> count yearly salary 20000 * 12 = 240000

tax amount = 10 % if saslary is less than 500000

1)if yearly salary is greater than 300000 then print "you have to pay tax
2)if yearly salary is greater than 700000 then print "you have to pay tax 12%
3)if yearly salary is greater than 1000000 then print "you have to pay tax 20%


Net salary of year after tax deduction
Net salary of month after tax deduction

get no from user and print table of that number
5
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10



start 1

end   50


3 and 4 print --> sum 

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ......

5 5*4*3*2*1 = 120


//while ---> bank balacnce 0-> 10000
